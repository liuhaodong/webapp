### Version control - Git (15/15)

### Iterative development (10/40)
- -6, hw4 feedback: -3, The email confirmation pages do not seem to be based on your Grumblr design. All pages of a web app should have a unified look and feel.
- -4, hw4 feedback: -0, For following/blocking/disliking, it's not necessary to make a separate model for that relation unless you want to attach additional information to that relation. Instead, a better relation to use would be the Many-to-many relationships.
- -20, hw4 feedback: -10, No Django forms apart from examples used. Using this feature improves your web app by encapsulating (and performing) input validation.
