### Basic HTML/CSS (20/20)
+ We recommend validating your HTML pages with the [w3c validator
    tool](http://validator.w3.org/) to ensure that your markup is correctly
    formatted. For example, the validator found that you have an unescaped &amp;
    on your home stream page

### Version control - Git (10/10)
+ -0, In the future we would like to see slightly more granularity in your
    commits. It will benefit you to commit early and commit often.
